# TimeSeriesClassification-LSTM-AN2DL
 The goal of this project is to develop models that can accurately classify time series data into one of multiple classes. The dataset used in this project consists of time series sequences and their corresponding labels. The models are evaluated based on various classification metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
